Quadro de Desenho (Drawing board) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It's a empty canvas where you can draw whatever you want with a color of your choice.
